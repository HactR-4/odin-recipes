<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Momo is the colloquial form of the Tibetan word "mog mog".[2] It is possible that this Tibetan word is borrowed from the Chinese term momo (馍馍), a name traditionally used in northwestern Chinese dialects for bread.[3] The word mo (馍) itself means food related to flour.[4] As can be seen in dishes from Shaanxi cuisine like roujiamo and paomo. In eastern China, buns with or without stuffing are called 馒头 (mántou). In northern China, before the Song Dynasty, buns with or without stuffing were both called 馒头 (mántou), but after Song Dynasty, stuffed buns were called 包子 (bāozi).[5] The different names for the dumpling include Assamese: মম; Bengali: মোমো; Hindi: मोमो;Ladakhi: མོག་མོག་ Nepali: मम; Nepal Bhasa: मम, small momo - ममचा; Tibetan: མོག་མོག་, Wylie: mog mog; simplified Chinese: 馍馍; traditional Chinese: 饃饃; pinyin: mómo.</p>
<p>As for the Himalayan momo, the dish is believed to have spread to Nepal along with the influx of the Tibetan diaspora. Since this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that travelling Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe of momo from Tibet where the Nepali Newar Merchants used to go to trade and brought it back home to Nepal.[7] In Tibet, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak and occasionally potatoes and cheese. However, after arriving in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the momo was made vegetarian in the modern era to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus.[8] Unproven, but substantiated by the dates and references to momo in colloquial references, the civil war in Nepal pushed out the Nepali diaspora to seek a livelihood in India, which further increased to the prevalence of Himalayan style momo in the southern half of India.</p>
